Sprint 1: Image Capture Module Implementation

Sprint Objective:
Develop the image capture module for the facial recognition system.


Sprint Backlog:

User Story:
As an administrator, I want the system to capture facial images upon entry.


Story Estimation:
Estimate the effort required for implementing image capture.


Daily Scrum:
Daily Meeting:

Developer 1: "Yesterday, I started researching image processing libraries in Java. Today, I'll begin implementing the image capture module."

Developer 2: "Yesterday, I set up the development environment. Today, I'll join in implementing the image capture module."

Adapt Plans:
Adjust the focus based on progress and challenges encountered.

Development:
Iterative Implementation:
-Use libraries such as JavaCV or OpenCV for image capture.
-Develop a module allowing interaction with the camera.
-Implement logic to capture facial images upon entry.

Continuous Testing:
Conduct unit tests to ensure proper image capture functionality.
Test integration with the developing system.

Sprint Review:
Product Demonstration:
Showcase the functioning image capture module.
Gather feedback on the quality of captured images.
Sprint Retrospective:
Identify any issues or improvements in image capture.
Adjust the plan to address received feedback.
